# Orsa

Orsa is a system for monitoring software project code. An easy way to think of it is like the code intelligence system that's built into an IDE, but headless and queryable so that you can get access to every thing it finds. It's also pluggable, so if it doesn't get the data you need then you can easily add more scanners, indexers, summarizers or rules.

As software projects grow in both code size and contributors, keeping track of it can be a problem. What node modules define the Selector React object? What modules will be effected when I make a change? Who uses the `inverted` attribute on the Button component? These questions, and more, are what Orsa was designed to answer.


## Origin of the name

Orsa is the word for a female bear in Spanish. And like a bear with her cubs Orsa gives you the opportunity to watch over you codebase and nurture it into the system you've always wanted.
